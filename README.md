# Coding-Examples-Done-by-Myself
These are some of the coding projects I have previously completed. 
Some of these projects required a text file to be read into the program.
So if that text file is not in the same folder then the program wont function properly.
These progrmas more or less just show that I am somewhat knowledgable with the Python language.
